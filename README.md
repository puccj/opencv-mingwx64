# opengv4.5.5-minGWx64
A prebuilt version of OpenCV made for MinGW compiler (x64). <br><br>

In the <a href="https://opencv.org/">openCV site </a> the prebuilt version for Windows is only made for Visual Studio compiler, so I needed to build the source myself with CMake to make it work for my case (MinGW x64). <br>
I upload the files here in order to save me (and anyone with the same compiler) time in the future.
